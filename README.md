ðŸ“š Book Inventory Selector

This project is a simple Book Inventory Management application built using React and Redux Toolkit. The application manages a collection of books and allows users to filter books based on their genres. Redux Toolkit is used for efficient state management, and selectors are implemented to enhance performance and filter data dynamically.

Features

	â€¢	React for building the user interface.
	â€¢	Redux Toolkit for state management, reducing boilerplate code, and improving application performance.
	â€¢	createSelector from Redux Toolkit for filtering books based on genres, ensuring optimized state queries.
	â€¢	Genre Filters: Easily switch between different genres (e.g., Horror, Fantasy, Science Fiction) to display books of that genre.
	â€¢	Dynamic Updates: The displayed book list updates based on the selected genre without re-fetching data.

Tech Stack

	â€¢	React
	â€¢	Redux Toolkit
	â€¢	JavaScript (ES6)

 Folder Structure

	â€¢	src/: Contains all the React components and Redux logic.
	â€¢	app/: The Redux store configuration.
	â€¢	features/: Contains the slice for managing book inventory.
	â€¢	components/: Contains the React components like BookList, GenreSelector, etc.

Future Enhancements

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
